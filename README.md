<h2><strong> Work Experience</strong></h2>
-☏ Telesales Partner -<strong> Squadstack </strong>
Companies I remeber i have worked for : -

📞 OLA - I was working as test call agent for the marketing of Ola S1 scooter , where we were working with the customers who have either visited or intersted in the Ola S1 scooter , We have to do a quick survey with the customers sharing the features and provide of Types of financial ways we have that they purschase the product , our main motive was to atleast convince the customer to have a look on their nearby service and showrooms of Ola and they can a test ride also can proceed witht their checkout steps .

📞 Delhivery - I was working as a call agent for the confirmation of the address and product ready status manager partner , my work was to call the delhivery warehouse owners to confirm with pickup details and location , so that the team of delhivery can proceed for the pickup and logistic part .

📞 Classplus - I am still working with this company as a sales agent for their wobile application , here i am wokring with Teachers , small insitute owners , Government exam , Grduation Tution , Class 10th , 11th , and other peoples related with some kind of business with education , for sharing the features and at least convinicing the customer them to have atleast a demo with our agents .

📞 Dream11 - May be this was my second company or may be 1 of my early starting 3 companies , whose task were shared with me and i was working with them for their call and sales agent , but for the dream11 i find the funny and intersting part with their this calling campaign becuase while i was calling the customers , some of them were from village area and have a lot of age and the campaign was like the Platform was offering joining bonus for the customers and at the time the first prize winner will get a car and in the previous financial year the !st prize winner received the winning rpize like this only (bike , iphone ) and others and they all were finding this a scam and obviously both the parties were correct at the time because at that time and present time , most of the new companies offer some joining bonus for new customer , to capture a audience for them . So , Team Dream11 if you find this then please have strict checking for your marketing list you recevies and runs your campaign with

and one of the company was realted with the loan selling business for them also i was working with customers having financial needs and While working with all the companies i found that the customers list they recieve have most of the customers who were not intersted at all for product or ever inquired about the companies product and I found this very funny because as a digital marketer certified and with my knowledge and little bit of experience i find this thing as the basics for marketing of any organisation because if you are sharing the information or marketing your company with peoples who never ever searched for you are not intersted it gives a bad impact for the rest of the industry and related industry , It leaves a bad impression for everyone and also as a Aritificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Student , while having data for your company for marketing purpose , the first step we do Data Cleaning in which we remove (missing values ,  duplicate values , and fix inconsistency - Standardize units, correct typos, and resolve encoding issues.) and after Passing our Raw Data with 7 steps we extract the information from the data which is of our use , but atleast these companies must pass their marketing data with these key points of Data cleaning , so that they can have a Diamond information from the coal mill , which are their customers ,also they must understand their niche , customers information and few other parameters which are very essential for the overall business , in Starting it may take some time but trust me it's the only process which you truly will provide you with Unbeievable Results . This is the only section of this complete which i am posting on one of my github account if 100 % written by me rest of the information is completey mine but seriously , this is my first time that i have started sharing my working Online because all of my devices storage are almost full and due to this reason i have lost many of my certificates , work that i saved on some of my storage device and some of my personal belonging and they all are lost . This is just the Start . Hope you all will be good and doing great in your life . Stay tuned for my app named Emaildb where i will be posting the purest list of customers for marketing with the niche and i would try to provide it more than 99 percent precise for the related industries.

This platform helped me a lot seriously with the public communication , at the time i was in my teenage and was studying about the pros of Public speaking and their were a lot of pulic speakers having a good amount of audience base with them and For calling customers in my most of working week days covering almost 6 day atleast for  1 - 2 hour depending upon the time i left for walking on my rooftop in evening time after completing all my homework and online classes from my school and Not only i gained a positive experience while working this company but their were few pending goals left on the app becuase now i hardly get the time for myself to go out and Chill and one of the goal was going to next tier .I don't what should i call this and it was happening everyday for the starting 15 minutes atleast , is supposed to call customers and their direct answer was rejection and that feeling was yrr may i will not able to convivnce the customer to take on the goal objective of the task due to my speaking skills and after those first 15-20 mintues every customer i was calling and now this time our conversion timing will be more than 3 to 4 minutes , sometimes it also went upto 5 - 5 50 . 

My first comapny while started working , It was also pickup agency tied with flipkart and online shopping companies and here i gained a complete strength with English language with the customer for adding them as a freelancer with company and it was also related to pickup enquiry if it is done or not and i feel i have almost expertise for English language for both verbal and written cause my studying medium was always English but it was my first time as a telesales partner and directly it was a workrelated for adding the freelancer and pickup agents to the app and for most of calling time ,i had interaction with people from south side and eastern side of our country .
